Inspiration
Laughing has always seemed to be the most important thing in my life. In particular, dry sarcasm has always been my favorite form of comedy. The joy from a well placed, sarcastic comment can be infectious and produce temporary happiness with everyone around. 

Sarcasm can be difficult for even humans to pick up on at times, and it is even more difficult for Artificial Intelligence. Many Language Learning Models, such as BERT or ChatGPT, have improved their sarcasm detection over the past few years, but still is not quite at the level of human detection. 

For an LLM to excell in human conversations, it must be able to know when the human is saying something sarcastic, and also know how to place a sarcastic response every now and again. With social media on the rise with over a billion users that want help to create a funny post, an LLM that could make people laugh with the use of sarcasm could make billions of dollars. Plus, with the incredible Reddit sarcasm dataset that came out in the last decade, this is very possible.

It is with this motivation that I plan to use the Reddit sarcasm dataset and apply it on an already functioning LLM to see if we can better detect sarcasm.



Project Overview

The project is split into a number of notebooks:

Capstone 1
Data Dictionary
Loading Reddit Sarcasm Corpus Data (train-balanced-sarcasm_csv)
General EDA and understanding of data

Capstone 2
Initial attempts of regression models 

Capstone 3
Applying regression models on top of an existing LLM (BERT or ChatGPT 3.0)
